# OCR System for Detecting and Recognizing Text in Real-World Images

> **End-to-end OCR system**: combines text detection (YOLOv11) with text recognition (CRNN + CTC) for reading text in real-world images.

---

## Purpose

- **Detect** text regions in natural scenes using YOLOv11.
- **Recognize** cropped text lines using a custom CRNN backbone with CTC decoding.
- Support standard datasets: ICDAR2003, ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015, or custom data.
- Modular design: easy to swap in new detection or recognition backbones.
- Visualize detections and recognized text end-to-end.
